    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as an introduction to LangChain agents. It covers key concepts, practical use cases, and provides a simple implementation to get you started. Agents are a powerful feature of LangChain that allow language models to interact dynamically with tools, external APIs, or custom logic, making them ideal for multi-step tasks and workflows.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what LangChain agents are.\n",
    "- Learn how to use tools with agents.\n",
    "- Create a simple agent-based application.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent's definition in LangChain\n",
    "Agents in LangChain allow dynamic task execution by leveraging large language models (LLMs) \n",
    "to decide which actions to take and in what order. The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. More technically, LangChain Agent is a framework that leverages language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic tasks by interacting with external tools and memory systems. These agents allow flexible decision-making based on user inputs, using a reasoning loop to analyze, decide, act, and repeat until the task is completed. LangChain agents utilize the ReAct framework, which combines reasoning and acting iteratively to tackle complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Andrew Ng](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1801295202788983136?ref=blog.langchain.dev) highlights a similar inclusive approach in machine learning and agentic systems. He notes that the field of machine learning has always welcomed diverse contributions, and similarly, when thinking about agentic systems, it's more useful to view them on a spectrum. Instead of debating whether something qualifies as a true \"agent,\" systems can be seen as being \"agent-like\" to varying degrees, allowing for more flexibility and creativity in development. This inclusive mindset encourages newcomers to build simple agentic workflows and iteratively make their systems more sophisticated, a perspective that aligns with how LangChain supports the development and evolution of agent-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of an agentic application:\n",
    "* Tools: These enable agents to access external data sources or perform computations (e.g., using APIs, querying databases, or running Python code).\n",
    "* Memory: Provides context by storing past interactions. This memory can be short-term (e.g., recent actions) or long-term (retrieving relevant historical data for current tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use LangChain Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike simple prompts that generate responses, agents bring the following advantages:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Tool Usage**: Agents can call APIs, query databases, or execute Python code.\n",
    "- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: They can break down complex problems and solve them step-by-step.\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: Agents can adjust their actions based on the state of the task or user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Agents Work?\n",
    "Agents follow a reasoning loop where they:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze the user's query.\n",
    "2. Decide the next action (e.g., which tool to use).\n",
    "3. Observe the results.\n",
    "4. Repeat this process until the task is complete.\n",
    "5. LangChain agents often employ the ReAct framework, which interweaves reasoning and acting steps iteratively for complex decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain continues to refine agent functionality, integrating innovations like multi-agent collaboration and enhanced memory systems to tackle more sophisticated challenges.\n",

    "## Practical Introduction to Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the definition of an agent, let’s dive into building our first agents using LangChain. Agents are powerful constructs that dynamically decide the sequence of actions required to achieve a goal by reasoning through tasks and utilizing tools effectively. Before jumping into implementation, it’s crucial to understand the key components of LangChain agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Agents in LangChain\n",
    "1. Schema\n",
    "    * AgentAction: Represents the action an agent decides to take, such as calling a specific tool. It includes the name of the tool and the corresponding input required to execute the action.\n",
    "    * AgentFinish: Marks the conclusion of the agent's task. It specifies the final output produced by the agent when it determines no further actions are necessary.\n",
    "    * Intermediate Steps: These are the sequence of actions and observations recorded during the agent’s reasoning process. This log provides visibility into the agent's decision-making, making it easier to debug or understand its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Agent:\n",
    "The Agent encapsulates the reasoning and decision-making process of the system. It operates by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Taking inputs like user queries and context.\n",
    "    * Producing outputs after reasoning through the task, which could involve calling tools and processing intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AgentExecutor:\n",
    "The AgentExecutor is the operational engine that drives the agent. It manages the reasoning loop, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Deciding the next action based on observations and context.\n",
    "    * Executing the chosen action.\n",
    "    * Observing the result and feeding it back into the reasoning process.\n",
    "This loop continues until the agent reaches a conclusion or a defined stopping condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tools:\n",
    "Tools are external resources or functions that agents use to accomplish specific tasks. Each tool has:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A name: To identify it within the system.\n",
    "    * A description: Explains its functionality to the agent.\n",
    "    * Input/output handling: Defines how the tool processes data and returns results.\n",
    "Examples of tools include search engines, APIs, computational libraries, and custom business logic integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details and specific code examples, you can explore the [LangChain Agents Documentation​](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/)\n",

    "## Summary of Agent Types in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has historically supported several agent types, each designed to handle specific use cases for reasoning and action. Here's a brief overview of the primary types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: An agent that uses a zero-shot approach to reason and act based on a single input prompt. It dynamically decides the next step, whether reasoning or invoking tools, without relying on examples.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Best for quick, one-step tasks that require dynamic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `REACT_DOCSTORE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: Combines reasoning and action for tasks specifically focused on document retrieval and question answering using a document store.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Useful in scenarios where knowledge is confined to a local document repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `SELF_ASK_WITH_SEARCH`: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: An agent designed to iteratively decompose a question into smaller sub-questions, answer them, and use search capabilities for external data when needed.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Suited for complex queries requiring external data retrieval and stepwise reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION`: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: A conversational variant of the zero-shot agent that incorporates context from prior interactions to provide continuity in dialogues.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Ideal for chatbot-like scenarios where maintaining context across multiple turns is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: A zero-shot React agent specifically designed for chat-based contexts. It leverages a single prompt to reason and act dynamically, tailored to conversational workflows.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Ideal for tasks where a chat interface is the primary interaction medium and tool usage is minimal or straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: A chat-oriented React agent that incorporates conversational memory, allowing it to consider prior interactions when making decisions or generating responses. This enhances continuity in dialogues and supports more nuanced conversations.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Best suited for chatbot applications or multi-turn interactions where maintaining the conversation’s context is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`: \n",
    "    * Description: This agent is a variant of the zero-shot React agent specifically optimized for chat-based models. It excels in invoking tools that require multiple structured inputs, ensuring accurate and well-formatted interactions.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Suitable for workflows where tools or APIs have multi-field inputs, such as data retrieval systems or complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `OPENAI_FUNCTIONS`: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: Designed to work with OpenAI’s fine-tuned models that support functions (e.g., for specific APIs or structured outputs).\n",
    "    * Use Case: Helpful in integrating OpenAI’s functionality seamlessly into workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `OPENAI_MULTI_FUNCTIONS`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Description: An advanced variant of OPENAI_FUNCTIONS capable of managing multiple functions within the same workflow.\n",
    "    * Use Case: Useful for sophisticated applications requiring interaction with several APIs or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information see [LangChain repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/agents/agent_types.py). These older agent types have been deprecated in favor of a more streamlined and robust set of agent types that leverage standardized approaches.\n",
    "Also, the LangChain documentation categorizes agent types based on features like intended model type (chat models or LLMs), support for chat history, multi-input tools, parallel function calling, and additional model parameters. It provides guidance on when to use each type, such as tool-calling agents for specific functionalities or legacy OpenAI tools for older models.
